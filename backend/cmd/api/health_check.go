// we put the handler as a method to the application because is cool and a way to make dependencies available to our handlers just in the application structure which we can put there when we initialize it in main and all of this without resorting to global variables or closures

// Q: Why is writer passed as value and request as pointer?
// request is passed as a pointer mainly because it is a big struct, and passing as a pointer makes stuff just faster
// but the reason for using writer as a value still confuses me mainly because i dont really know how does go implement the interface stuff
// here is a link to literally an explanation on that :3
// READ!!!
// https://research.swtch.com/interfaces
// Because it's an interface.
// An interface is a "fat-pointer", it's a two-word value with one pointer to the data and other pointer to a method table.
// lets implement them in c
